   <h2>World-Class Haircuts, Shaves, & Grooming Services for Men in Carmel, IN</h2>
  <p>At Str8-Edge, we’re more than just your neighborhood haircutter – we are your comprehensive partner in style. We spend hours discussing the finer points of an incredible haircut, we’ve searched far and wide to assemble the best team of stylists and barbers around, and we watch the trends in men’s style and fashion like a hawk to make sure we provide you the best haircut every single time you come into our salon. Our mission is to make you look, feel, and perform at your very best – and we offer a suite of the best haircuts, shaves, face and scalp treatments, and other grooming services to help you get there..</p>

   <h2>A Classic Barbershop Experience</h2>
  <p>Here at Str8-Edge Fine Men’s Salons – Carmel, we’ve recreated the classic barbershop experience – the same one your grandfather would have loved – and modernized it for the 21st century. When you first walk through our doors, you’ll be greeted by a cold beverage from our stocked fridge and wide-screen TVs playing the big game. Your barber will then lead you to your own semi-private grooming station, where you’ll get a haircut or grooming service that you’ll swear was intended for royalty. When we’re all finished and you walk out, you’ll feel like a brand new man – and trust us, everyone in the office will notice. Get ready to enjoy the Str8-Edge experience and stop by to see us today!</p>
